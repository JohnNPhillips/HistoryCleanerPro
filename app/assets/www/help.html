				<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
				<p>
					History Cleaner Pro is a powerful utility that can clean the history and other data of many apps on your device. While we try to test our apps on as many devices and ROMs as we can, we cannot test all of them. As such, we highly recommend using a backup program such as Titanium Backup or something similar. Because this app performs undocumented Android actions, this app is made available for you at your own risk with no warranty of any kind.

				<h3>Instructions</h3>
				<p>
					<h3>Clearing Data</h3>
					In the main screen, all of the available applications are listed; apps that are supported but are not installed your device are automatically hidden.
					You can check or uncheck the boxes next to the individual items indicating whether or not you want them to be cleared.
					When done, just press the "Clear Items" button on the bottom to clear the selected items.
					
					<h3>Viewing Data To Clear</h3>
					You can view the saved data for most items by long-pressing the name of it and selecting "View Items". Note that not all items support viewing the data to clear.
					
					<h3>Shortcuts</h3>
					Shortcuts are a way to clear certain items with ease. To create a shortcut, you must first create a profile containing all of the items to clear (see section on Profiles). To add a shortcut to your homescreen, long press on a free area on it, and select "Add Shortcut". A list of available shortcuts should pop up, scroll down to "History Cleaner" and select it. Next, select the profile that you want to associate with it and press ok. A shortcut should then be successfully placed on your homescreen somewhere. By simply pressing the shortcut, all of the items in the selected profile will be automatically ran.
					
					<h3>Profiles</h3>
					Profiles are a way to save certain lists of selected items to easily use later. To save a list of items as a profile, while in the main screen with the list of items, press the menu button. Select "Save as Profile". Next, enter any name in the box (to overwrite a profile, just enter the same name) and press ok. It should then appear in the profiles tab in the main app. To delete a profile, just press the "Settings" button next to it, and select "Delete". To view the items in a profile, press the "Load" button, and it will be loaded into the "Clear" tab.
